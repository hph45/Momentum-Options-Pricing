# Momentum Options Pricing

The is my take on the traditional Black-Scholes-Merton Options Pricing formula. This model is currently only supporting european call options. There are no current plans to expand this. The motivation behind this project is a 2004 paper titled _The 52-Week High and Momentum Investing_ by THOMAS J. GEORGE and CHUAN-YANG HWANG.
